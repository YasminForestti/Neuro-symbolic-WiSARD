# Neuro-symbolic-WiSARD
This project implements a neuro-symbolic version of the WiSARD (Weightless Neural Network) model, combining symbolic rule insertion with statistical learning. It allows the integration of Boolean logic rules into the memory structure of RAM-based discriminators, controlled by a tunable alpha parameter.
